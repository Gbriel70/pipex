# Pipex üöÄ

*A project that recreates the behavior of the operator |  (pipe) of the shell, connecting two commands via fork(), pipe() and execve(). Ideal for learning about processes, I/O redirection and pipe management.*


# What is Pipex ?

Pipex is a simulation of the | from the shell. It allows you to execute two commands in sequence, where the output of the first command is passed as input to the second command, using pipes and processes.

# exemple

```bash
>$ ls | grep exemple.txt
```

```bash
>$ ./pipex input_file "ls" "grep exemple.txt" output_file    
```

# ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

Execution Flow

    Open Input/Output Files:

        input.txt ‚Üí Reading.

        output.txt ‚Üí Writing (created if does not exist).

    Create a Pipe:

        Two file descriptors: pipefd[0] (reading) and pipefd[1] (writing).

    Child Process 1 (cmd1):

        Redirects standard output (STDOUT) to pipefd[1].

        Run cmd1 (ex: ls).

    Child Process 2 (cmd2):

        Redirects standard input (STDIN) to pipefd[0].

        Redirects standard output (STDOUT) to output.txt.

        Run cmd2 (ex: grep .txt).

    Close Pipes and Wait for Processes:

        Ensure all processes terminate with waitpid().

```bash
input.txt ‚Üí [cmd1] ‚Üí (pipe) ‚Üí [cmd2] ‚Üí output.txt
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Use

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gbriel70/pipex.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd pipex
    ```
3. Compile the project using Make:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

Execute the pipex program with the following syntax:
```bash
./pipex <input_file> "<command1>" "<command2>" <output_file>
```
Example:
```bash
./pipex input.txt "ls -l" "wc -l" output.txt
```

# üß© Key Concepts

#### 1. Processes (fork())

    Creates a child process by duplicating the parent process.

    Tip: Use fork() to run cmd1 and cmd2 in separate processes.

#### 2. Pipes (pipe())

    Creates two file descriptors: one for reading (pipefd[0]) and one for writing (pipefd[1]).

    Attention: Close unused descriptors to avoid leaks!

#### 3. Redirection (dup2())

    Redirects STDIN/STDOUT to the pipe's file descriptors or files.

    Example: dup2(pipefd[1], STDOUT_FILENO) sends the output of cmd1 to the pipe.

### 4. Command Execution (execve())

    Replaces the current process with the executed command.

    Use access() to check if the command exists and is executable.

### 5. Error Management

    Always check returns from functions like fork(), pipe(), open().

    Use perror() for clear error messages (e.g. "Error: fork failed").


# üêõ Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem               | Probable Cause                | Solution                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Command not found     | Incorrect PATH or invalid command | Use absolute paths (/bin/ls) or check PATH.   |
| Pipe Leak             | Unclosed descriptors          | Close all descriptors with `close()`.         |
| Output file not created | Invalid permissions or path  | Use `open()` with `O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC`. |
| Commands stuck        | Pipe not closed properly      | Ensure that the writing side of the pipe is closed in the reading process. |

# üß™ Testing the Project

### Test Cases

1. **Basic Commands:**
    ```bash
    ./pipex input.txt "ls" "wc -l" output.txt
    # Equivalent to: ls < input.txt | wc -l > output.txt
    ```
2. **Commands with Arguments:**
    ```bash
    ./pipex input.txt "grep 'hello'" "awk '{print \$1}'" output.txt
    ```
3. **Intentional Errors:**
    ```bash
    ./pipex no_exist.txt "ls" "wc" output.txt # Invalid input file
    ```
4. **PATH Command:**
    ```bash
    ./pipex input_file "/usr/bin/ls" "/usr/bin/wc" output_file
    ```
